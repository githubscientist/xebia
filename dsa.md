Data Structures:

- Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently.
- There are different types of data structures that are suited for different kinds of applications.

Types of Data Structures:

1. Built-in Data Structures:

   - Arrays in Java and JavaScript, Lists in Python
   - Strings in Java, JavaScript, and Python
   - Dictionary in Python, Object in JavaScript, and HashMap in Java

2. Abstract Data Structures: The user-defined data structures.

   - Stack
   - Queue
   - Linked List
   - Tree
   - Graph

Stack:

- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- The main operations that can be performed on a stack are:
  - Push: Adds an element to the stack.
  - Pop: Removes an element from the stack.
  - Peek: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
  - isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.

Queue:

- A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- The main operations that can be performed on a queue are:
  - Enqueue: Adds an element to the queue.
  - Dequeue: Removes an element from the queue.
  - Front: Returns the front element of the queue.
  - isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.

Linked List:

- A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node.
- Each node has two fields: data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

Types of Linked List:

1. Singly Linked List: Each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence.
2. Doubly Linked List: Each node has a reference to the next and previous node in the sequence.
3. Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node.
